# Repository Name:Evaluation of Machine Learning Regressors

# Description:

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of various machine learning regressors . The models evaluated include Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Machine Regressor (SVR). The goal is to compare the performance of these models using key metrics and to determine which regressor is the most accurate for predicting.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes steps for handling missing values, feature scaling, and data splitting.

Model Implementation: Scripts to train and evaluate Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVR models.

Model Comparison: Detailed comparison of model performance with visualizations (bar charts, graphs) for MSE and RÂ².

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiments with different kernels and parameters for optimizing the SVR model.
    
Results Analysis: Analysis of results, including error rates and prediction accuracy across different models.
